I am Yuanzhe Ma, an incoming PhD student in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)](https://phd.ieor.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University in the City of New York. Previously, I obtained an MS in Statistics in Spring 2021 from the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/)  and  [Prof. Debankur Mukherjee](https://www.debankur-mukherjee.com/). I also obtained an MS in Mathematics in Spring 2021 from Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Michael Damron](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~mdamron6/). My MS thesis is titled “Numerical Estimation of Several Topological Quantities of the First Passage Percolation Model” and I studied some quantities in a random graph model using Python.

Before Georgia Tech, I joined a leading Fintech startup, 360 DigiTech, as one of the core team members in 2016, at the age of 19. Working with the Chief Data Scientist and the Chief Risk Officer, and as a machine learning engineer, I applied cutting-edge techniques in artificial intelligence to attack challenging problems arising in risk management and marketing. While working full-time, I studied part-time and received a BEc in Economics from East China Normal University and a GradDip in Mathematics with distinction from the University of London. In 2018, the company was listed on NASDAQ with code QFIN.

I am broadly interested in applied probability and optimization with applications to machine learning. More specifically, I am interested in:
- stochastic analysis with applications in queueing systems and optimization algorithms
- optimization theory
- operator norm of random matrices with applications in random graph and network science
- reinforcement learning

I have the following ongoing research projects:
- transient analysis of load balancing systems, joint work with Prakirt Raj Jhunjhunwala and Siva Theja Maguluri
- operator norm of random matrices, joint work with Debankur Mukherjee and Souvik Dhara

Selected PhD level courses at Georgia Tech:
- stochastics: stochastic processes 1 and 2, stochastic calculus 1, and probabilistic combinatorics
- statistics: theoretical statistics, linear statistical models, multivariate analysis, and testing statistical hypotheses
- analysis: real analysis 1 and functional analysis
- reading course in high-dimensional probability with Prof. Vladimir Koltchinskii
- others: computational statistics, reinforcement learning, and linear optimization
