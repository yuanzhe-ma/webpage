My name is Yuanzhe Ma (马远哲), an incoming PhD student in the [IEOR](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/) Department at [Columbia Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/). I obtained an MS in Statistics in Spring 2021 from the School of  [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, where I was fortunate to work with 
[Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/)  and [Debankur Mukherjee](https://www.debankur-mukherjee.com/). I also obtained an MS in [Mathematics](https://math.gatech.edu/) in Spring 2021 from Georgia Tech, advised by [Michael Damron](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~mdamron6/).

I can be reached at yuanzhe.ma[at]columbia[dot]edu.

I am broadly interested in applied probability and optimization with applications to machine learning. More specifically, I am interested in:
- Stochastic Analysis with applications in queueing systems and optimization algorithms
- optimization theory
- operator norm of random matrices
- reinforcement learning

I have the following ongoing research projects:
-Transient analysis of load balancing systems, joint work with Prakirt Raj Jhunjhunwala and Siva Theja Maguluri.
-Operator norm of random matrices, joint work with Debankur Mukherjee and Souvik Dhara.
