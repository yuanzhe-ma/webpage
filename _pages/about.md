My name is Yuanzhe Ma, an incoming Ph.D. student. I finished an MS in Statistics from the School of  [ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, where I was fortunate to work with Professor
[Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/)  and Professor
[Debankur Mukherjee](https://www.debankur-mukherjee.com/). I also finished an MS in [Mathematics](https://math.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech, where I was advised by Professor [Michael Damron](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~mdamron6/).
