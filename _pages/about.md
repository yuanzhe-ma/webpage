I am an incoming PhD student in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). Previously, I obtained an MS in Statistics in Spring 2021 from the School of [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/)  and  [Prof. Debankur Mukherjee](https://www.debankur-mukherjee.com/). I also obtained an MS in [Mathematics](https://math.gatech.edu/) in Spring 2021 from Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Michael Damron](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~mdamron6/). 

Before Georgia Tech, I joined a leading Fintech startup, 360 DigiTech, which was later listed on NASDAQ with code [QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/), as one of the core team members in 2016 at the age of 19. Working with the Chief Data Scientist and the Chief Risk Officer, and as a machine learning engineer, I applied cutting-edge techniques in artificial intelligence to attack challenging problems arising in risk management and marketing. While working full-time in Shanghai, China, I studied part-time by myself, took a sequence of exams, and received a BEc in Economics from East China Normal University and a GradDip in Mathematics with distinction from the University of London.  

I am broadly interested in applied probability and optimization with applications to machine learning. More specifically, I am interested in:
- analysis of stochastic systems 
- nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization theory

I have the following ongoing research projects:
- transient analysis of load balancing systems, joint work with Prakirt Raj Jhunjhunwala and Siva Theja Maguluri
- operator norm of random matrices, joint work with Debankur Mukherjee and Souvik Dhara

Selected PhD level courses at Georgia Tech:
- stochastics: stochastic processes, stochastic calculus, and probabilistic combinatorics
- statistics: theoretical statistics, linear statistical models, multivariate analysis, and testing statistical hypotheses
- analysis: real analysis and functional analysis ([basis theory](https://people.math.gatech.edu/~heil/papers/bases.pdf)) 
- reading course in high-dimensional probability with [Prof. Vladimir Koltchinskii](https://math.gatech.edu/people/vladimir-koltchinskii)
- others: computational statistics, [reading group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sRq7foYxyH34-UJ0gpsoHF5zICkexnMIaKu5cpnzZxU/) in reinforcement learning, and linear optimization
